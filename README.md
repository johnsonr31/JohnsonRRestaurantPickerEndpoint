HOW TO USE: Open the project in VSCode and click "Run and Debug." After you've clicked this, the program will run and open the API in your web browser with a URL starting with "localhost." When it does, copy this URL into an API platform such as Postman, or just continue in your browser. Either way, edit the URL to add "/RestaurantPicker/restaurant/fastfood" if you want to pick a Fast Food restaurant, or "/RestaurantPicker/restaurant/chinesetakeout" if you want a Chinese Takeout Restaurant, or "/RestaurantPicker/restaurant/italian" for an Italian restaurant. Whichever of the three you enter, the API will return a randomly generated string of text with the name of a restaurant fitting the category you entered in the URL. If you enter the url more than once, the API will return a different restaurant name
